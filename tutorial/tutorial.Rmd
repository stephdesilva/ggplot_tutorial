## Should you bother with ggplot?

Switching to data visualisation through code is a huge ask.

Is this how you feel about code?

![How I used to feel about code.](./images/michael_fear.jpg)

This is a _perfectly normal reaction_.

### But..! Can you do this?

![You can do this.](./images/excel.png)

__Then you're already writing code. Maybe you don't think about yourself as a programmer ... yet! __

## Ggplot lets you maximise your creativity with data

Let's think about something really important to us: witch trials in the middle ages and reformation periods.

Ggplot can help us tell a story in a few charts.

This cannot possibly be a good news story:

```{r echo = FALSE}

bydecade <- db[,c(2,4,5)] %>% 
      group_by(decade) %>% 
      summarise(deathsDecade = sum(deaths, na.rm = TRUE), 
                triedDecade = sum(tried, na.rm = TRUE)) 

ggplot(bydecade, 
       aes(x = decade, y = deathsDecade))+ 
  xlab("Decade")+
  ylab("Deaths")+
  geom_line() + 
  theme_light()+
  theme(legend.position="bottom")+
  theme(
    axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1, size = 10))+
  ggtitle("Number of deaths over time")
```

But was all Europe the same?

```{r echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE, messages = FALSE}
ggplot(db)+
  facet_wrap(~country)+
  geom_jitter(aes(x = decade, y = deaths), colour = "steelblue4", alpha = 0.5)+ 
  xlab("Decade")+
  ylab("Deaths")+
  theme_light()+
  theme(legend.position="bottom")+
  theme(
    axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1, size = 10))+
  ggtitle("Number of deaths over time")
```

So deaths were predominantly in a few countries, does that mean that witches weren't a concern elsewhere?

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE, messages = FALSE}
ggplot(db)+
  facet_wrap(~country)+
  geom_jitter(aes(x = decade, y = tried), colour = "plum4", alpha = 0.5)+ 
  xlab("Decade")+
  ylab("Deaths")+
  theme_light()+
  theme(legend.position="bottom")+
  theme(
    axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1, size = 10))+
  ggtitle("Number of trials over time")
```

OK witchcraft was an issue across Europe, but the deaths due to trials and the number of trials were geographically located for a reason.

We got all of that out of three charts with ggplot.


## Anatomy of a ggplot

The hardest thing about a ggplot is .. all the stuff. Let's break one open and see what's under the hood. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

data<-read.csv("./data/donor-declarations-categorised-2016.csv")

data$recipient.name<-as.factor(data$recipient.name)
data$party.group<-as.factor(data$party.group)

data$donor.category<-as.factor(data$donor.category)
data$donor.postcode<-as.numeric(data$donor.postcode)

statelist<- c("ACT", "NSW", "NT", "QLD", "SA", "TAS", "VIC", "WA")
conservative.list<-c("Australian Christians", "Family First Party", "Family First Party - SA", "Democratic Labor Party (DLP) - Queensland Branch")

 data$recipient.group<-NA
 for (i in 1:length(data$donor.state)){
   if((data$donor.state[i]%in%statelist)==TRUE){data$donor.state[i]<-data$donor.state[i]}
   if((data$recipient.name[i]%in%conservative.list)==TRUE){data$recipient.group[i]<-"Conservative"}
   if((data$recipient.name[i]%in%progressive.list)==TRUE){data$recipient.group[i]<-"Progressive"}

   if((data$recipient.name[i]%in%narrow.list)==TRUE){data$recipient.group[i]<-"Narrow Focus Parties"}
   if((data$recipient.name[i]%in%LNP.list)==TRUE){data$recipient.group[i]<-"LNP"}
   if((data$recipient.name[i]%in%minor.list)==TRUE){data$recipient.group[i]<-"Minor Parties"}
   if(is.na(data$recipient.group[i])==TRUE){print(data$recipient.name[i])}
 }



 colour_vec<-c("#00239C" ,"#CE0056","#00B08B", "#89532F", "#BB29BB", "#75787B", "#000000", "#991E66", "#006F62" )
 
data$donor.state<-factor(data$donor.state, levels=c("ACT", "NSW", "NT", "QLD", "SA", "TAS", "VIC", "WA", "NA"))
data$recipient.group<-factor(data$recipient.group, levels=c("LNP", "Labor", "Greens", "Immigration Parties", "Minor Parties", "Narrow Focus Parties", "Conservative", "Progressive"))
```

Here we've got the donation data from 2015-2016 for Australian federal political parties. Yes, I'm loads of fun at dinner parties.

```{r echo = TRUE}

ggplot(data)+
  labs(x="Recipient", y="Donor Category")+
  geom_jitter(aes(recipient.group, donor.category, colour=recipient.group), alpha=0.4)+
  scale_colour_manual(name="", values=colour_vec) +
  theme_light()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

So we have our plot, but how does it all fit together?

![Exploded ggplot](./images/anatomy of a ggplot.png)

## Let's build one of our own

Ggplot is the R implementation of _The Layered Grammar of Graphics_. There are a few layered grammars in the data science world, and this was probably the first.

That means that you build a base plot, then add the optional extras.
Let's try one of our own.

Back to the witches!

In order to use ggplot, you need to load it onto your computer using `install.packages("ggplot2")` once only.

Ever time you want to use it you load it into your _working environment_ with `library(ggplot2)`. You only need to do this once per session.

`db` is the dataframe we have stored the witch trial data in. It's alot like a spreadsheet, really.

### Layer One: make a ggplot _object_

```{r buildPlot1, exercise=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(db)
```

Nothing much happened. We have created a ggplot _object_ and we told ggplot where to find the data on it, but nothing else.

We build up ggplot layers by adding `+` at the end of every line.

### Layer Two: add `geom_point`. 

To do this, we need to tell ggplot what kind of point and that means calling the _aesthetics_ of the geom. 

We don't need to use `library(ggplot2)` every time we want a ggplot, so we'll omit it from now on.

```{r buildPlot2, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(db)+
  geom_point(aes(x = decade, y = tried))
```

Note how I declared that the x axis is the decades, and the y the number of people tried. This told `geom_point()` how it needed to work.

... OK we've got something! 


Can you make the points red? 


Sometimes we can use colour to describe information on the plot. Take out the `colour = "red"` and put `colour = country` inside the `aes()` call. What happens?


### Layer 3: Facetting

One of the most useful things about ggplot is the ability to break out many charts at once to make quick comparisons. It's called _facetting_ the chart. Let's do that.

```{r buildPlot3, exercise=TRUE, fig.height = 7}
ggplot(db)+
  facet_wrap(~country)+
  geom_point(aes(x = decade, y = tried))
```

We can control how the facetting looks. Try changing the facet line to `facet_wrap(~country, ncol = 3)+` 

### Layer 4: Make it look good.

The grey background for ggplot2 is a bit 2008. Try adding theme_light() at the end.

```{r buildPlot4, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(db)+
  facet_wrap(~country, ncol = 3)+
  geom_point(aes(x = decade, y = tried, colour = country))
```

_Opacity_ is another great way to see data when you have many observations. Try adding `alpha = 0.4` to the `geom_point()` call. It goes after the `aes()` part.

### Layer 5: Tell people what they're looking at.

Time for some titles. You can use `ggtitle("Insert my title here")` and layers `xlabs("label x")` and ylabs("label y") to add further layers to your plot.

```{r buildPlot5, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(db)+
  facet_wrap(~country, ncol = 3)+
  geom_point(aes(x = decade, y = tried, colour = country), alpha = 0.4)+
  theme_light()
```

## Get beyond the bar chart

The whole point of coding up your visualisations in ggplot is that you can get _really_ creative.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# data from: http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=36&p_display_type=dataFile&p_startYear=&p_c=&p_stn_num=066062 22/09/18
temp <- read.csv("./data/IDCJAC0002_066062_Data1.csv")

temp$date <- paste(temp$Year, temp$Month, "01", sep = "-")
temp$date <- lubridate::ymd(temp$date)

```

```{r echo = FALSE}
temp$Month <- factor(temp$Month, labels = c("January",
                                               "Febuary",
                                               "March",
                                               "April",
                                               "May",
                                               "June",
                                               "July",
                                               "August",
                                               "September",
                                               "October",
                                               "November",
                                               "December"))
```
Take the daily maximum temperature in Observatory hill, Sydney: can you pretty this one up a little?

```{r temp1, exercise = TRUE}

ggplot(temp)+
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = Mean.maximum.temperature...C.))
```

### Only look at what you want to

Looks like we have something of a trend over time here. We could actually work a little R magic on this one and perhaps just look at January temperatures:


```{r temp2, exercise = TRUE}

ggplot(filter(temp, Month == "January"))+
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = Mean.maximum.temperature...C.))+
  theme_light()
```

Just a boring old line plot. Can you add some colour, maybe change the `geom`, facet it ... or something?

### It doesn't have to be boring in R

The great thing about these exercises is you can do your best to break these plots.. and then hit reset. Have a go at this one and see what you can do with it!



```{r temp3, exercise = TRUE}

ggplot(temp)+
  facet_wrap(~Month)+
  geom_jitter(aes(x = date, y = Mean.maximum.temperature...C., colour = Month), alpha = 0.2)+
  theme_light()+
  coord_polar()+
  ylab("Mean maximum temperature (celsius)")+
  ggtitle("Mean maximum temperature in Sydney")
```

## Ggplot plays nicely with others

Open source software lives and breathes on people with great ideas just going for it.

Interactivity is one of those ideas.

```{r echo = TRUE, fig.height = 8}
library(plotly)
ggplot(data)+
  labs(x="Recipient", y="Donor Category")+
  geom_jitter(aes(recipient.group, donor.category, colour=recipient.group), alpha=0.4)+
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "lines"))+
  theme(legend.position="bottom")+
  scale_colour_manual(name="", values=colour_vec) +
  theme_light()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
ggplotly()
```

This is going to be _very_ useful, right? It only took two additional lines: `library(plotly)` at the beginning and `ggplotly()` at the end of the ggplot.

Let's try another:

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE, messages = FALSE, fig.height = 8}
ggplot(db)+
  facet_wrap(~country)+
  geom_jitter(aes(x = decade, y = tried), colour = "plum4", alpha = 0.5)+ 
  xlab("Decade")+
  ylab("Deaths")+
  theme_light()+
  theme(legend.position="bottom")+
  theme(
    axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1, size = 10))+
  ggtitle("Number of trials over time")
ggplotly()
```

Fingers crossed you feel like you can jump into ggplot now!
